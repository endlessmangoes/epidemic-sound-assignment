# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\

### `npm build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

## Design Decisions

- Project structure
  - components
    - contains all components, each within its own folder. Each folder contains the component, styles and its tests.
  - providers
  - reducers
  - hooks
  - constants?
- removing Navigation, and making the app as a single view containing, Playlists, Tracks and the Audio player
  - 
- 

## Things to change if I had more time

- Adding TypeScript, and building the app with vite (using updated create-react-app)
  - Mainly for type-safety. I do remember this being a goal for technologies used within Epidemic, I tried doing this for 1hr on Saturday and failed. Since I only have a day left I'm just focussed on building the core requirements.
